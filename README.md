# stanford_cs224d
This repo contains problem set solutions and other resources associated with Stanford’s course CS224d: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing (Spring 2016).  Updates are posted incrementally as we cover material in our meetups, so only the solutions to problems that we have already gone over are posted here.
